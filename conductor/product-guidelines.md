# Product Guidelines

## Tone and Style
- **Friendly and Accessible:** The application and its documentation should use plain, welcoming language. Technical concepts should be explained simply, using helpful tips to guide users through complex configuration steps like network setup or camera discovery.

## Visual Identity
- **Modern and Clean (Material Design):** The UI should follow Material Design principles, utilizing a clear visual hierarchy, consistent spacing, and a professional color palette. This ensures high usability and a polished, contemporary feel for the web dashboard.

## Error Handling and Notifications
- **Action-Oriented Messaging:** Error messages should avoid purely technical jargon where possible. Instead, they should concisely explain the issue and provide a clear "Next Step" or "Fix It" action to help the user resolve the problem independently.

## Interface Design Principles
- **Video-First Layout:** The live view and playback screens should prioritize the camera feeds, minimizing surrounding UI elements to reduce distractions.
- **Responsive Grid:** The dashboard must automatically adjust the camera layout based on the user's device and screen size, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Interactive elements, especially those controlling video streams (start/stop, playback seeking), must be highly responsive to provide a seamless and fluid user experience.

## Documentation Structure
- **Hybrid Approach:** Documentation should provide both task-based tutorials (e.g., "Adding your first camera") for quick wins and a reference-style manual for in-depth understanding of all system settings and features.
